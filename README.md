# foody-game

Hi Cankut, I coded this for a randomizer game while in college- the framework is all there but the randomizer function at the end of the game is not working. I'm pretty sure its a linkange problem from my index <head> section -> restaurants.js file. 
  
  If you play the game, there is no function at the end (location, atmosphere, price, name) which should be directly taken from my restaurants.js file.
  
  Could you take a look at my link path in index.html and possibly find a soltion?
  
  THANK YOU :)
